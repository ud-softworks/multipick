# multipick

Flutter multipick lets you select easy things which are related.
I have a lot of (stupid) ideas to enhance this a lot.

## WARNING

This is currently just the beginning of this new package. I will start working on this package this week.
I just want now to setup the environment for everything.

DON'T USE THIS NOW :-)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
